## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **MCP Server with Developer Tools** (`mcp_dev_server.py`)
- ✅ File operations (read, write, append, delete, move, copy)
- ✅ Directory management (create, list, delete)
- ✅ Code execution (shell commands, Python code)
- ✅ Search capabilities (pattern matching in files)
- ✅ Git operations (status, diff)
- ✅ File information retrieval

### 2. **AI Coding Agent** (`ai_coding_agent.py`)
- ✅ **Planning System**: Breaks down complex tasks into actionable steps
- ✅ **Memory Management**: Persistent memory across sessions
  - Conversation history
  - Task plans and results
  - Learned patterns
  - Error logs
- ✅ **Feedback Loop**: Evaluates results and learns from errors
- ✅ **Bedrock LLM Integration**: Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet model
- ✅ **Tool Integration**: Connects to MCP server for tool usage
- ✅ **Task Execution**: Step-by-step execution with error handling

### 3. **Command-Line Interface** (`chat_interface.py`)
- ✅ Interactive chat with the agent
- ✅ Rich formatting with syntax highlighting
- ✅ Command system (/help, /memory, /plans, etc.)
- ✅ Session management (save/load)
- ✅ History tracking
- ✅ Status monitoring

### 4. **Testing & Examples**
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (`test_setup.py`)
- ✅ Usage examples (`example_usage.py`)
- ✅ All core functionality tested and verified

## 🎯 Agent Characteristics

As requested, the agent exhibits these characteristics:

1. **Uses LLM**: ✅ Integrated with AWS Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
2. **Plans & Breaks Down Tasks**: ✅ TaskPlan system with step decomposition
3. **Has Memory**: ✅ Persistent AgentMemory class with file storage
4. **Uses Tools**: ✅ Full MCP server integration with 15+ developer tools
5. **Feedback Loop**: ✅ Evaluation system that learns from outcomes

## 🔧 How to Use

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Set AWS credentials
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your-access-key'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your-secret-key'
export AWS_REGION='us-east-1'  # Optional
```

### Running the Agent
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test the setup
python test_setup.py

# Run the agent
python main.py
```

### Example Interactions
- **Simple Question**: "What is a REST API?"
- **Code Generation**: "Create a Python function to calculate fibonacci"
- **Debugging**: "Fix this syntax error: def func(x) return x*2"
- **Project Building**: "Build a todo list application"

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Workflow
```
User Request → Planning → Execution → Evaluation → Learning → Response
                  ↓           ↓           ↓           ↓
              Task Plans   MCP Tools   Feedback    Memory
```

### Memory Persistence
- Conversations and plans saved to JSON
- Learning patterns accumulated over time
- Error logs for continuous improvement

### Tool Integration
- FastMCP server provides standardized tool interface
- Agent can read/write files, execute code, search codebases
- All tools accessible through MCP protocol

## 📊 Test Results

All tests passing:
- ✅ MCP Server: Tools loaded and functional
- ✅ Agent Modules: Memory and planning working
- ✅ Chat Interface: Interactive UI operational
- ✅ File Operations: Read/write/delete verified

## 🎉 Success Metrics

1. **Complete Implementation**: All requested features implemented
2. **Working System**: Tests pass, examples run successfully
3. **Production Ready**: Error handling, logging, and persistence
4. **Well Documented**: README, examples, and inline documentation
5. **Extensible**: Easy to add new tools or modify behavior

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

If you want to extend the system:
1. Add more specialized tools (database operations, API calls)
2. Implement multi-agent collaboration
3. Add web interface alongside CLI
4. Integrate with more LLM providers
5. Add code review and testing capabilities

## 📝 Notes

- The system is fully functional without AWS credentials for local tool usage
- With AWS Bedrock credentials, the full AI capabilities are unlocked
- Memory persists between sessions for context retention
- The agent learns from errors and improves over time
